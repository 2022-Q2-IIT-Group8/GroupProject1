        <h1 align="center">Autonomous vehicles</h1><br><br>
        <p>Autonomous vehicles are automobiles that can operate without human interference this is often referred to as “self-driving”. These vehicles use multiple systems that utilize aspects of machine learning, sensors and algorithms, all powered by durable processors to carry out what’s needed to keep the driving systems functioning. The Society of Automotive Engineers has defined that there are six levels of driving automation. Level 5 is completely autonomous, and Level 0 is manual. The types of vehicles that have been made autonomous are cars, watercraft, aircraft, rockets, spacecraft, and overs.  Autonomous vehicles are generally built up of multiple automated systems workers in unity for different functions.
</p><br>
        <p>
            Fully autonomous vehicles aren’t common, due to road rules and legal obligations these systems do take time to roll out to the general public. While some systems offer “self-driving” technologies for cars, humans still need to sit in the “pilot seat” in case the conditions are outside of the autonomous vehicles system regulated parameters. These Vehicles have been around for decades but its been in recent years that there has been an increase in the private car market, as time goes on we can expect to see more technological advances making the steering wheel a thing of the past. 
        </p>
        
        <p>Autonomous vehicles are used in agricultural farming, mining, military, forklift and car crash testing. The future of autonomous vehicles is undefined, the technology is there, but the testing and security aren’t. More tests and research must be done to make autonomous vehicles mainstream, for the safety of the public and the trust of individual people, so they feel safe around these new machines. In the next 5 years, it's predicted that there will be a massive increase in levels of 3,4,5 autonomous vehicles on the road. As the demand rises, so do the competitors to ouch match each other in this new market. 
        </p>
        <p>Autonomous technology is already in use, some fine-tuning may be needed before it can be rolled out on a large scale. Advance Driver assistance systems were one aspect that helps created what autonomous vehicles are today. ADAS was a similar technology but used backup cameras emergency braking, and automatic cruise control that could adapt to certain requirements for self-parking parking systems. This technology is not new, however, it built the foundation for what is now and to come. Without artificial intelligence, automation wouldn’t be what it is today. AI gives the system the ability to be able to “learn” and make judgements based on past situations they have confronted and analysed. 
</p>
        <p>Trials are an important interaction between the technology road and the user. NRMA says that “all states and territories should settle trial arrangements as soon as possible. Trials should be facilitated in a range of driving environments, including in rural, regional and urban settings.”
 
The main impact of this development is worker displacement, which means that ride-share drivers and pilots will have to move into different roles to adapt to this new technology. There would be no need for drivers once all roads have self-driving cars. This can help safeguard humans against hazards and increase their safety. Leaving there no error for human mistakes and simply removing the people from the workplace. We have seen this in the automation of fighter drones, there's now no need for any more “top guns” putting themselves on the front line. This change can also lead to emotional pressure. Alongside this the worker may be forced geographically to find other work which would cause them to relocate, putting pressure on the individual. 
</p>
        <p>Trains in Japan have already taken on the approach of adopting simple Autonomous systems that work on simple rail networks where they can only travel forward and backward. A way to picture this is like a 2D drawing vs cars which are 3D-4D. Car ownership is going to change in the future, as these new self-driving cars require more technology, they usually will cost a lot more than your standard car. The Australian government is always increasing its metro works, which in turn will make travelling via public transport more affordable than owning your own autonomous car. Trains have started to convert into autonomous vehicles slowly in Japan and Australia already has the world's largest network of driverless trains.</p>
        <p>In my daily life, autonomous vehicles will affect me greatly. Putting my trust in self-driving taxis/Ubers is going to be a new concept that I will have to learn to trust. Driving on the road will ultimately be very different once this new technology beings to be rolled out. Second guessing if someone is behind the wheel of a car, not knowing if it’s a robot or a person would seriously play a part in how I travel on roads. I believe that the difference for me will be a lot of human interaction.</p>
        <p>Thanking the bus driver is a regular occurrence for me, waving to another driver on a long road trip always makes me feel at ease in some way. For me, there’s life behind the vehicle. Automation doesn’t have that, it has algorithms and outcomes, memories that the system looks through in split seconds to decide on the best possible outcome. My family members are in the travel/farming industry, my dad is a truck driver, this will negatively affect him, causing his job to no longer be needed.My uncle is a farmer and having automated tractors would positively affect him, making him be able to focus on other things rather than driving around all day. Overall, automation is already everywhere we go. </p>
        <p>This is just an advanced level up. With everything, it will take time to adapt and maybe one day ill become reliant on this new technology. Personally, this will make me want to see what new jobs will be created because of these advances, and open new doors to jobs that weren’t around years ago.</p>
