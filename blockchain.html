        <h4>What does it do?</h4>
        <p>Blockchain technology was first purposed in 1982 by Cryptographer David Chaum : (Sherman, 2010). It wasn’t
            touched on again until 1991 for the purpose of not being able to tamper with document time stamps. Jump
            forward to 2008 when Blockchain was conceptualised by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi
            Nakamoto on the back of cryptocurrencies (Glance, 2022).<br>

            In a simplistic view Blockchain technology is a way of recording information where there is only one
            original version or ‘block’. It is almost impossible to copy or hack. A blockchain is essentially a digital
            ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on
            the blockchain.<br>

            Currently, the big hype with blockchain technology is Cryptocurrencies being popularised in 2016/17 and
            skyrocketing all over the news. There are other applications for blockchain technology such as smart
            contracts where and when certain conditions are met the computer will proceed without human interaction e.g.
            commands on the stock market, sending notifications etc. (What are smart contracts on the blockchain? | IBM,
            2022)<br>

            NFTs are another big sensation that took popularity over the last 2 years. NFTs are financial security made
            up of digital data stored in a blockchain and from an original ledger. More noticeably the digital art craze
            with more notable Bored apes etc. the most expensive to date has been Merge by artist Pak, with an auction
            price of US$91.8 million (Ghassemitari, 2022). But there have also been some serious losses as well in 2022
            once people calmed down from the bubble. One of the ten crypto punk Nft’s originally bought for $1 million
            US was sold again six months later for $139,836, a huge loss of 86%. (Badman, 2022)<br>

            Some recent applications of blockchain technology have been fairly interesting, to say the least. Some
            recent projects have been based on energy consumption. Most noticeably in France, there has been a
            significant push and encouragement for a blockchain-based energy sector. Over the next five years, there are
            both peer-to-peer energy trading and electric vehicle sharing start-ups allowing to track people's use and
            ability to share energy between individuals instead of pulling energy from the main distributors. (Omezzine
            and Schleich, 2022)
        </p><br>

        <h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
        <p>The future of blockchain is very interesting with its application in many industries with its ability to
            overcome the problem of trust while transferring value across the internet or a network (Kuperberg M, 2019).
            There are a few industries that will be changed maybe even challenged with its application in the future and
            some people and government bodies might feel the effect in a negative way as it will make certain jobs more
            streamlined and or unnecessary.<br>

            People will notice certain changes in regards to personal identity and its applications with services that
            might require a password or signature etc. This will make the internet safer as it will be harder for people
            to steal and access people's private information. This will also make it easier for people to vote in most
            countries without the fear of corruption.<br>

            Its application in making buying assets and even homes easier and faster. Instead of having to wait on banks
            for up to a month or even more in some cases to verify your credentials that you are who you say you are.
            This could make future banking more automated and decrease the need for lawyers and other people in the
            sector who are responsible for verification. Along with stamp duty which is one of the biggest taxes on
            people when it comes to purchasing their future homes (The European Business Review, 2021).<br>

            The potential for blockchain is endless into the future even though there will be an effect on industries to
            make them more automated and decrease the need for human interaction. There will, of course, be a need for
            more people to help build and maintain this industry with dedicated networks to provide these services which
            will of course come at a cost. Will it be more expensive than having human beings?? yes….potentially, in the
            beginning anyway but as the technology evolves and is adapted into the future like most technology in the
            past it becomes more feasible.

        </p><br>
        <h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
        <p>
            This type of technology should make life potentially easier in theory. With the examples written above the
            security that blockchain can give people can rest relatively comfortably. But I do find it interesting that
            in an age where people as very concerned about their privacy (understandably). With blockchain technology,
            it could possibly make it easier for people to be monitored especially with the application of identity
            which would make that information more accurate when it comes to big companies that would require your
            authentic digital imprint. Which may be used to sell to certain companies or used by them to understand your
            particular habits to make it easier for them with certain sales etc.<br>

            Like every generation before us, there will undoubtedly be people who get lost in this advancement of
            technology and will want things to go back to the way they were because they can’t remember certain vital
            pieces of information or get confused about how it used even though for the majority of people it would be
            straight forward and the pro’s easily out way the cons.<br>

            This will be resolved over time as there might be a possibility that with blockchain technology everyone may
            be given their unique digital imprint on the day they are born just like a birth certificate or Medicare
            card that could be universal to the world. With regards to my friends that are in my current age group, I
            cant see this affecting them it's just another adaptation that they will go through where there may be some
            hurdles but will be streamlined over time.<br>
