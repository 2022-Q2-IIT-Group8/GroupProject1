        <h4>What does it do?</h4>
        <p>Cybersecurity can be defined as the “collective methods, technologies, and processes to help protect the
            confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer systems, networks and data, against cyber-attacks
            or unauthorised access. The main purpose of cybersecurity is to protect all organizational assets from both
            external and internal threats as well as disruptions caused due to natural disasters.” (What Is Cyber
            Security and How Does It Work? | Synopsys, 2022)<br><br>

            As we move from the information Age to the Age of Experience, digital transformation has reshaped our world
            and will continue to disrupt. While technology is a key driver for realizing social and economic benefits,
            it also brings about new security challenges.<br><br>

            Given the rapidly evolving technological landscape and the fact that adoption of software is ever increasing
            across various sectors including finance, government, military, retail, hospitals, education, energy,
            increased information is becoming digital and accessible through wireless and wired digital communication
            networks and across the omnipresent internet. This is of great value to criminals which is why it is
            important to protect it using strong cybersecurity measures and processes.<br><br>

            The importance of good cybersecurity strategies is evident in the recent high-profile security breaches of
            organisations such as Yahoo, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), who lost sensitive user
            information that caused irreparable damage to both their finances and reputation. The rate of cyber-attacks
            shows no sign of slowing down and companies, both large and small, are targeted everyday by attackers to
            obtain sensitive information or cause disruption of services. (What Is Cyber Security and How Does It Work?
            | Synopsys, 2022)<br><br>

            Software constantly changes when it is updated and modified, which introduces new issues and vulnerabilities
            and opens it up for various cyber-attacks. Furthermore, IT infrastructure evolves as well with many of the
            companies already migrating their on-premises systems to the cloud which introduces a whole new set of
            design and implementation issues resulting in a new category of vulnerabilities.<br><br>

            Technology is essential to giving organisations and individuals the computer security tools needed to
            protect themselves from cyber-attacks. Three main entities must be protected: endpoint devices like
            computers, smart devices, and routers; networks; and the cloud.<br><br>

            Common technology used to protect these entities include next-generation firewalls, DNS filtering, malware
            protection, antivirus software, and email security solutions.<br><br>

            Organisations should perform a formal risk assessment to identify all valuable assets and prioritise them
            based on the impact caused by an asset when it's compromised.<br><br>


            Security reviews include application and network penetration testing, source code reviews, architecture
            design reviews and red team assessments amongst others. Once security vulnerabilities are found,
            organisations should prioritise and mitigate them as soon as possible.<br><br>

            Backing up all data periodically will increase redundancy and will make sure all sensitive data is not lost
            or comprised after a security breach. Attacks such as injections and ransomware compromise the integrity and
            availability of data. Backups can help protect in such cases. Sensitive information should be stored and
            transferred using strong encryption algorithms. Encrypting data ensures confidentiality.<br><br>

            Company policies should enforce the use of strong passwords that adhere to industry recommended standards
            for all employees. They should also be forced to be periodically changed to help protect them from
            compromised passwords. Two-factor authentication should be used for all high-level user accounts that have
            unrestricted permissions.<br><br>

            In addition, educating employees and raising awareness of company policies and security best practices
            through seminars, classes, and online courses is the best way to reduce negligence and the potential of a
            security violation.<br><br>

            As cybersecurity is evolving fast, there needs to be a consideration of how it could look in the future.<br><br>

            As cloud technology continues to be used, there could be a lot more vulnerabilities in the future.
            Artificial Intelligence could be employed to have computer security algorithms that will have specific bots
            that will hunt for threats and act against bad bots. This would be important to leverage upon as we can
            expect to have large scale attacks and supply chain attacks by private and adversarial government
            actors.(The Future of Cybersecurity: What Will it Be in 10 Years? | 10Guards, 2022)</p><br>

        <h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
        <p>
            A lack of focus on cybersecurity can damage businesses in a number of ways: (Why is Cybersecurity Important?
            | UpGuard, 2022)<br><br>

            Economic Costs: Theft of intellectual property, corporate information, disruption in trading, and the cost
            of repairing damaged systems<br>

            Reputational Cost: Loss of consumer trust, loss of current and future customers to competitors, and poor
            media coverage<br>

            Regulatory Costs: GDPR and other data breach laws mean that the organisation could suffer from regulatory
            fines or sanctions because of cybercrimes.<br>

            Cybercrime Magazine has mentioned that there would be 3.5 million openings in 2025 in the US. Many cybersecurity jobs are advertised in order to generate potential replacement candidates in a
            competitive market with high turnover. Every IT position is also a cybersecurity position now. Every IT
            worker, every technology worker, is involved at some level with protecting and defending apps, data,
            devices, infrastructure, and people.<br><br>

            Research from Cybersecurity Ventures has been vetted and shared by hundreds of colleges and universities
            globally in an effort to educate students (and parents) and attract them to potential careers as cyber
            defenders.<br><br>

            Cybercrime, which is predicted to cost the world $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, up from $6 trillion in
            2021, will continue generating a number of new jobs roughly equal to those being filled over the next 5
            years.<br><br>
            According to the Australian Government's own Cyber Security Strategy, 'Australia is suffering from a cyber
            security skills shortage.' This shortage provides a unique opportunity for cyber security students as,
            according to Australian employment projections, demand for their skills and services will grow by at least
            21% to May 2023. (Australia’s Cyber Security Strategy, 2022)<br><br>
            The 2022 LinkedIn Emerging Jobs Report lists Cyber Security Expert as one of its top fifteen emerging jobs.
            And a recent federal government report estimated Australia would need another 11,000 cyber security
            specialists over the next decade. (LinkedIn Jobs on the Rise 2022: The 15 Australian roles that are growing
            in demand, 2022)<br><br>
        </p>
        <h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
        <p>Cybersecurity will be an important feature in our daily lives at home, work and school as we move into the
            post digital age with the development and use of numerous technologies. (TechCrunch is part of the Yahoo
            family of brands, 2022)<br><br>


            With the smart phone being a classic example of technological convergence, we use it make calls, use the
            GPS, take digital images, use it like a computer to surf the internet, use the banking apps to perform
            financial transactions and many other tasks. We also store confidential and sensitive information. When
            Personally Identifiable Information (PII) gets leaked, it can be used for fraudulent activities. (What is
            Technological Convergence?, 2022)<br><br>


            Knowing this, it is crucial that we raise our awareness and also educate ourselves on securing the device
            and also securing the information on the device. From the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) website,
            there are a number of guidance we could follow such as leaving the Bluetooth off, backing up data,
            protecting against mobile malware and checking permissions. (Cyber Security for kids, 2022)<br><br>


            At work, we get emails from unknown sources with links to click but as we are aware of phishing attack, (an
            attempt, usually via email, to trick you into clicking on a hyperlink that will put malware on computer) we
            delete them or send them to spam folder. At other times, some emails, known as Spear Phishing (involve the
            attacker impersonating a friend or coworker, usually with the goal of getting you to share account login
            credentials) are sent to trick us to divulge sensitive information or process banking transactions. With
            company control cybersecurity training and control checks in place, we could have the protocol for
            alternative authentication checks. (The Truth about Cybersecurity Awareness Training, 2022)<br><br>


            In today’s connected world, everyone benefits from a cybersecurity program. At an individual level, a
            cybersecurity attack can result in everything from identity theft to extortion attempts, to the loss of
            important data like family photos. When at work, especially if it is related to critical infrastructure like
            power plants, hospitals, and financial service companies, securing these and other organisations is
            essential to keeping our society functioning.<br><br><br>
