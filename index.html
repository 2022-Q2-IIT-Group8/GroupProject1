            <p>I am Shampee and my roots are from Bangladesh, a land of rivers, and now living in the Greater Sydney
                area of NSW for more than 10 years. My favorite hobbies are dancing, graphic arts and watching art films
                including anime. At TAFE (technical and further education) Hornsby, I completed a Diploma in Website
                Development. While doing the course, I found it quite remarkable and interesting how we were able to
                employ creativity in technology with the help of some codes and weird languages. I am planning to
                complete the Bachelor of Information Technology program at RMIT to hone my skills and further explore
                the industry as a full-stack Web Developer.</p>

            <p>I am from Lismore, NSW. I got my first degree from southern cross university and have been a physical
                therapist since 2014. I reside in Hervey Bay QLD, where I started a physical therapy clinic with my best
                friend in 2018. I like surfing and snowboarding and have a two-year-old black labrador named Soda. My
                interest in I.T is due to the problem-solving component and the ever-changing landscape as technology
                grows. Currently have no experience in the field apart from troubleshooting and using cloud-based
                storage programs for work. </p>

            <p>I am 17 years old, and I live in Perth, WA. I am currently undergoing this Introduction to IT course as
                well as the Introduction to Programming course at RMIT. I really like programming and am enjoying
                learning Python as well as casual programming on Scratch (with Scratch blocks) and Khan Academy (with
                JavaScript and HTML). I usually like to compose songs on the piano or on a music software called FL
                Studio in my free time. I also solve Rubik’s cubes and other similar puzzles (2x2, 4x4, Pyraminx, Skewb,
                and Square-1). My fastest time for solving a Rubik’s cube is 7.22 seconds and I can solve it anytime
                within 20 seconds.</p>

            <p>I was born in Melbourne in 1998. My family background is Austrian and Italian. In 2016, I graduated from
                Wesley College and obtained my VCE. I have a Certificate II in Electrotechnology. I speak fluent English
                but would love to learn another language one day. I have a 6-month-old puppy named Loki. He is an
                American Staffy Cross, and we rescued him from the pound in February of this year. I am not sure Loki
                was the most appropriate name for him as Loki is the “god of mischief”. Consequently, he is always up to
                no good.</p>

                There are 6 personality types in Holland’s model and my code is CARISE. My most favored personality type
                is Conventional followed by Artistic and Realistic. According to the results, a Web Developer role would
                be a 75% match with this personality code. </p>
