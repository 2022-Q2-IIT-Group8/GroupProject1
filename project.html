        <h3>Overview </h3>
        <p> We want to create a free-of-charge smartphone application that can be used to search for circular economy
            products, services, and events around the world. It will work as a platform to promote a zero-waste policy
            by reducing, recycling, reusing, and informing the user about their chosen products. It will include
            articles about the circular economy. How and where to find products to recycle and reuse. Without being
            aware of food wastage, people throw away food every day — from uneaten leftovers to spoiled produce. By
            simply putting the product's name, this app will sort household waste, helping to reduce the fraction of
            unsorted waste as well as informing the app owner of products and compies carbon footprint so you can
            purchase ethical products. It will create cooking recipes by adding the ingredients you have. To make food
            waste prevention fun and easy, users need to open the menu page on the app and choose a recipe. It will help
            us to use what we have, so nothing goes to waste as well as support other businesses and companies that are
            ethical when it comes to their carbon footprint and waste management!</p>
        <img src="Circular.png" alt="image of the project">

        <h3>Motivation </h3>
        <p> After joining an online seminar on the circular economy, Shampee was motivated and determined to reduce
            waste and help the earth to go green in every way possible. For a long time, she was thinking of a way to
            create awareness of waste, especially food and products, and how to reduce it. Creating an application with
            some information and sorting bins and food recipes will give us a chance to contribute to making the earth
            clean and green as well as helping educate people on how products are really made and at what cost to the
            environment and giving other environmentally friendly alternatives. We were thinking of a way to show the
            products of all environmental choices, drastically reduce the use of natural resources and cut or eliminate
            emissions and waste. Creating an application will increase the awareness of the people while sitting in
            their comfort zone! </p>

        <h3>Description  </h3>
        <p> This app will help the user to understand how a circular economy works, how important it is to save our environment, and how we can reduce our waste by reusing products, creating new recipes, and educating people so they are able to make ethical choices with their everyday product.. My app will have a simple quiz section where users will answer questions about waste and the circular economy and will get some points. With that extra point, they will be able to swap a product. There will be a reward system where users will be able to see how green they are which will continue to change as they make more informed choices by purchasing more ethical and sustainable products at their local grocery store. Also, they will get notifications about software updates as well as events and products of the circular economy. 
        </p>
        <p>Mobile application development is a step-by-step process for creating apps for mobile devices, like phones and tablets. In addition to collecting valuable user data, ramping up marketing activities with push notifications — personalising customer approach — and the ability to work offline, mobile apps provide businesses and users with more functionality than a website, like creating an easy-to-use loyalty program right in the app itself. </p>
        <p>The app will feature: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Push notifications</li>
            <li>Community wall</li>
            <li>Surveys and questionnaires</li>
            <li>Video, image, and audio hubs</li>
            <li>Image Recognition technology</li>
            <li>Calendar integrations</li>
            <li>Ecommerce carts</li>
            <li>Menu system</li>
            <li>Event page</li>
            <li>Selecting products and Bins</li>
            <li>Bin Quiz</li>
            <li>User directory</li>
            <li>User Feedback</li><br>
        </ul>
        <p>
            After building the app, we will develop an MVP—minimum viable product. The app idea behind an MVP is that it will force me to think about the app’s most essential features. This is an important aspect of the app project on the path to creating a successful app.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the MVP is finished, and we will have a working app, then need to test it before deployment.
            The app must be tested on actual mobile platforms. Between iPhones, iPads, Android devices, progressive web apps, smartphones, tablets, and more. I need to check if the app works online, offline, and so on. Devices with different software versions or screen sizes might have issues needing to be fixed before it goes live.             
        </p>
        <p>
            Will go through usability testing with actual test users such as friends, family, and colleagues as well.
            After manual testing, it is necessary to conduct advanced testing using written scripts to test the app. If there is an omission in terms of workflow and logic, it is necessary to react in a timely manner and fix the problems.             
        </p>
        <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
        <p>First, we need to create a wireframe, a rough layout of a mobile app. Anyone can create a wireframe on a piece of paper, a whiteboard, napkin, or use a digital wireframing tool. The purpose of the wireframe is to simply illustrate the app’s features and lay out the schemes.
        </p>
        <p>Also need to create the overall style of the app, including things like the colour scheme, font selection, and buttons and widgets. Design encompasses the user interface (UI) and the user experience (UX).
            we will use Hybrid App development. Most hybrid builds rely on Javascript, which is a web technology. This coding language will help to create an app once and deploy it on multiple platforms like iOS and Android. The flexibility of a hybrid app is still high in terms of what the app can accomplish. While we will not need a developer who specialises in low-level coding to build it, they still need to have web development skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                Utilising technology such as Vuforia Cloud Recognition we will be able to recognise and track millions of images for products that customers will upload to their own personal profiles. As well as using cloud-based data storage from Amazon web service which is great for start-ups due to its auto-scaling ability so it limits the chances of the platform crashing.
            </p>
            <h3>Skills Required</h3>
            <p>The most important aspect of mobile app development is building a high-quality user interface (UI). The UI of an application is responsible for interaction between the user and the software. When it comes to developing mobile applications, it is not enough for them to simply have adequate backend functionality. With a plethora of apps available to download, the most attractive are the apps that are easy to use, have a superior design, and run smoothly. 
            </p>
            <p>As a developer, we need to have a knowledge of multiple operation platforms in the current industry. As far as market penetration, there are three major mobile platforms: Android, iPhone, and smartphones. 
                Need to have the skill and knowledge of backend computing like security, database management, hardware interaction, implementation of memory allocation
                </p>
                <p>Another important skill required is using modern programming languages like C# and Java, HTML 5, and CSS. Knowledge of mobile platform Application Programming Interfaces (API) such as Apple iOS, Android, and Windows Mobile. Able to implement the use of cross-platform mobile suites like Antenna and AMP (Accounting-Management-Promotion). </p>
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>Every year, a third of the food produced worldwide is tossed in the trash. By reusing the foods and ingredients that we already have at home, we can save our money, and time, and on top of everything food waste! A terrific way of using technology to conserve the environment in the process. </p>
            <p>Many of us need to join forces to live sustainably. I do hope that this application will have a knock-on effect by allowing people to make better-informed decisions on their everyday purchases and their overall effect on the environment. Along with making companies strive to be more ethical in the way they conduct themselves. With better education, it will make it harder for certain companies to greenwash their public appearance which could hopefully encourage them to change to more sustainable practices. But whether it  is saving water or energy, recycling waste, choosing renewable energy, or moving around without generating emissions. Thankfully, technology is travelling in the same direction - we can now count upon many applications to improve our daily effort in caring for the environment. </p>
