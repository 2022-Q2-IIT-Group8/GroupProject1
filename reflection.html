        <p>At our virtual team meeting we have made great progress on our ability to talk together openly and honestly. We keep improving on it in each meeting. We challenge each other and disagree when we need to, inviting and welcoming all perspectives. Everybody had a different part to play, and we coordinate and align our work to contribute our best.</p>
        <p>IT systems and applications played a vital role for working together virtually. Like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We circulate document for comments. The comments are collected and incorporated into the document.</li>
            <li>Meeting agendas and notes ensure nobody misses important information.</li>
            <li>Implement project management (who needs to do what by when within a guidance process).</li>
            <li>Have virtual meetings through Ms Team video conferencing.</li>
            <li>Use collective writing through applications, such as Google Docs, that manages versions, allows comments, and tracks changes.
</li>
            <li>Github helped to put things together to present our work as a collective collaboration.</li>
            <li>Going above and beyond to help explain IT systems in great detail</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For the future there are a few areas that we can improve on. 
</p>
                <ul>
            <li>Making sure that everyone is supported in their ways of working.</li>
            <li>Planning out what tasks are meant to be dived up equally amongst the team. 
</li>
            <li>Preplanning some of our important major meetings.</li>
            <li>Give and receive more feedback on work</li>
        </ul>
        <p> But it was a very short period of time that we came to know each other. Everyone spoke up and everyone acknowledged that there were things we could do better, like invite our quiet contributors to speak, ask for help when we need it, and listen better. But, overall, we did well.</p>
        <p>Working as a group is very much like a high-maintenance machine, everyone has their part to play which is a key in making the “machine” operate. Without each member contributing the group would not operate successfully. Our team was extremely good at picking up on gaps in our work, and filling in when people were unavailable to join meetings.It's surprising to see how much each team member really looks out for everyone.</p>
        <p>Having a different set of skills, made our team unique and successful. We learnt new skills from each other. Our personality tests shows that we all have different personality type. And that lead us to work together without having any personality conflict. Each team member played their role well with due respect to different opinion. Even though we have different personalities, surprisingly we did well as we all share same interest and passion for diving into the world of IT industry.</p>
