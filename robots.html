        <h4>What does it do?</h4>
        <p>Robots are automated machines that can carry out a variety of tasks. They are designed for speed and precision in tasks, greatly reducing human effort. They use artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve their operation.
            Robots are becoming increasingly used in areas such as the household, for industrial work, in medicine, and in security and defense. There are many different uses of robots today in different areas. There are mobile, industrial, service, modular, collaborative, and educational types of robots. Mobile robots are designed for tasks which need the robot to move around. They are designed to move through the use of wheels, tracks, or legs if they are designed for land-based movement. They can also use propellers or similar air/water based types of movement. These types of robots could be classified as drones.
            There are also attempts to make robots re-usability in a wide variety of tasks. The most attempted type of robot used for a variety of different jobs are
            Robots have been made to do many different types of jobs from surgery bots in hospitals to service arms in industrial work. They are being experimented for different roles which would suit a future with robots as part of our daily lives.
            Household robots, for example a vacuum cleaner, are becoming common in households.<br>
            Robots used for industrial work are useful for tasks that could pose danger to humans. The implementation of robots in industrial work, it can increase the speed, production and quality of work over manual human labour.
            In Security, Robots can be tasked to monitor and survey a selected area and report any disturbances.<br>
            In the military, robots can perform dangerous jobs like arming and disarming bombs.<br>
            In Healthcare, robots can be used in surgery, which can lead to treating patients effectively and without human error. Although there are benefits to robotic surgery, for example, there are drawbacks to consider. How costly are robots going to be to keep them maintained and up-to-standard? Will computerizing many jobs lead to any potential downfalls in society?
            There will be a new wave of robots. Automated vehicles could be very common, or at least evident on roads. A study from Oxford University has estimated that at least 47 percent of jobs will be computerized within 20 years. Robots will be very evident in day-to-day life.
            The rise of artificial intelligence and the advancement of technology pave the way for the future of robots to be possible and likely to change how we do things today.<br>
            </p><br>

        <h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
        <p>
            Robots have certainly made an impact so far in our lives and is only continuing to grow and thrive. Each year, with better technology, there comes better advancements in robotics. There is a high chance that robots will be implemented for roles that a human being would normally do, potentially decreasing the number of available jobs there are in the workplace. As robots may take over normal jobs of humans, this doesn’t mean that humans will be shorthanded on jobs. The growth of robots will also increase the demand for its upkeep, maintenance, and continual improvements, which can lead to a whole new field of jobs. There will be people at risk of losing their jobs thanks to automation and robots’ usefulness. These include retail employees, Manufacturing employees, Food service, travel agents, Telemarketers, Delivery and postal workers, Printers and Publishers, Professional sport referees, dispatchers, and fishermen. These jobs will likely be automated, run by robots, or use machines that would do the role of a person. These jobs are at risk because of the decline of the need for the job, more efficient and faster machines or robots for the job, or the overall cost comparison between using a robot or a person for the job. 
        </p><br>
        <h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
        <p>
            The rise of robots will certainly change my life and the lives of others. It would transform the world as we know it today. If I happen to go to shop in person, I would probably meet a machine doing the job of a staff member, which would continually remind me of the evident existence of robots and automation. Every time I would receive mail or a delivery, I would meet a machine or drone to deliver my goods. This will certainly change my view on the world.
However, since I personally am interested in jobs relating to computing and programming, the influence of machines and robots in the workplace wouldn’t drastically affect me. I wouldn’t lose my job or be negatively changed by robots since the robot industry would grow the demand for programmers, computer specialists, artificial intelligence specialists, and similar jobs. With the growth of the robot industry, there is the growth of similar jobs to its upkeep. Hence, if I need to get a job with the skills and qualifications that I will likely get in the future, they would meet the standards for this new and growing job sector, which would have a good impact on my life.
